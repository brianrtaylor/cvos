1. INSTALLATION
==============================================================================
Dependencies:
    * VLfeat (NOT INCLUDED)
        (http://www.vlfeat.org/) 

    * FastEdgeDetection (INCLUDED)
        (http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/389109f6-b4e8-404c-84bf-239f7cbf4e3d/)
        "Structured Forests for Fast Edge Detection", P. Doll√°r and C. 
        Zitnick, ICCV13
    
    * Piotr's Computer Vision MATLAB Toolbox (INCLUDED)
        (http://vision.ucsd.edu/~pdollar/toolbox/doc/index.html)
    
    * Accurate fast marching toolbox (INCLUDED)
        (http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/24531-accurate-fast-marching)
    
    * Graph Based Image Segmentation (INCLUDED)
        (http://cs.brown.edu/~pff/segment/)
        "Efficient Graph-Based Image Segmentation" P. Felzenszwalb, D. 
        Huttenlocher, IJCV04
        Their package is C++ only. We include a MATLAB wrapper.

    * Recursive Bilateral Filtering (INCLUDED)
        ( http://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~qiyang/publications/eccv-12/ )
        "Recursive Bilateral Filtering", Q. Yang, ECCV12
        Their code does not allow the input to have only two channels (like
        flow does), so we modified their version to filter two-channel images 
        (as a special case), and also included a MATLAB wrapper.

    * SC - powerful image rendering for visualizing output (INCLUDED)
        (http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/16233-sc-powerful-image-rendering)

You must run "mex_setup.m" in prior to anything
